# Machine-Learning-Analysis-with-Venue-Review-Data

Package requirements are as stated in the jupyter notebook.
This project is originally put together to fulfill Mining Social and Geographic Datasets module at UCL.

This code discovers variable trends, analyses and runs supervised machine learning models including Naive Bayesian Classifier, Logistic Regression Classifier and Random Forest Classifier to predict positive reviews with natural language processing. It performs a grid search to determine best hyperparameters for models. 

It also briefly discovers Geospatial trends in data and visualisations.

Finally, it uses Latent Dirichlet Allocation model to perform topic modelling.

The dataset is too large to upload to this repository. You can download the data here: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1j_hia-TbTT-esvGlqSTYHCpx9IlN61Io/view?usp=share_link
